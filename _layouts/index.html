      <h3 style="color: red;">About Me</h3>
      <p> My name is Kevin Fisher, I am a computer programmer. I specialize in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. My knowledge base has come from lessons on Codecademy.com, W3schools.com as well as various websites and books.<br>
        My professional background includes around 3years in construction (carpentry, and various design, remodel, and repair work), 6yrs in sales, selling timeshares on the Vegas Strip for 3 years, followed by a year of college 
 while a single parent of a 4 year old. After completing almost all my prerequisites my son and I had to move back home with my family do to a severe back injury. After my first back surgery, most of my family moved to Whidbey 
 Island, Washington, where we now reside. Once we had begun to get settled I began to work and do all I could learning from any resource or job possible to make sure my son and my future was more secured. Life had other plans, 
 so I kept learning for fun and to one day reach new professional opportunities and hobbies so that one day I'd never have to work a day in my life with a career that I enjoy and am passionate about!</p>
<p> With experience in customer 
 services, communication, technology, and numerous programming languages I would like to be in a technical professional that allows me to continue my growth and feeds my passion for learning as well as want to be a real help to 
 people in such a vast, competitive, field such as computer science, IT, and programming. I'd love for my ideas with designing, developing and creating site content to be my focus with networking and cybersecurity being my 
 specialty. Designing and deploy webpages that are easy to navigate, and aesthetically appealing to the viewer is a hobby of mine. While focusing on website design and development I have also gained knowledge in numerous 
 programming languages including: Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Python, Git, Command Line, SaSS, AngularJS, ReactJS 1.x, SQL, Bash/shell, as well as Java, C++, and C#. Web Development, Networking, and Cybersecurity is my main career focus
