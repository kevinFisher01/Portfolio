        <h2> Kevin Fisher's Portfolio </h2>
        <div>
      <p style="text-align: justify"> My name is Kevin Fisher, I am a computer programmer. I specialize in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. My knowledge base has come from lessons on Codecademy.com, W3schools.com as well as various websites and books. <br>
        With a background in sales mostly, with experience in customer services, communication and technology, I would like to translate ideas by designing, developing and creating site content. Designing and deploy webpages that are easy to navigate, and aesthetically appealing to the viewer is a hobby of mine. While focusing on website design and development I have also gained vast knowledge in numerous programming languages including: Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Python, Git, Command Line, SaSS, AngularJS, ReactJS 1.x, SQL, Bash/shell, as well as Java, C++, and C#. Web Development is my main career focus.</p>
